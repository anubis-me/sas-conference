Impressing his supervisors, Professor Ajaya Vinu left India after obtaining a prestigious doctorate fellowship on immobilising biomolecules in a nanoporous system in Germany, going on to further respected positions in Japan and Australia, including International Young Scientist Fellow and Future Fellowship. Teaching himself many scientific principles, Professor Ajayan Vinu has honed his passion and experience working with nanomaterials, devoting his career to exploring their development, capabilities and applications in energy generation and storage, drug delivery, carbon capture and conversion, and catalysis. Just a couple of the projects under his leadership include utilising nanomaterials to convert carbon dioxide into clean fuel with only sunlight and water, value adding products through catalytic pathway, utilising nanoporous architectures for developing next generation energy storage and conversion devices, and the selective removal of cancer causing molecules. Now the Director of the University of Newcastle’s Global Innovative Centre for Advanced Nanomaterials, Professor Ajayan Vinu is leading the charge in translating basic materials research into real-world products. The centre has established a global research environment with a high standard of novel ideas for developing excellent advanced technologies for the betterment of society, specifically looking at energy, environment and health solutions. Thinking back to his roots, Professor Ajayan Vinu is focused on working to nurture the next generation of brilliant minds with a motto in mind – save the world and help the people.

                      Dr Carla Meledandri is a Lecturer in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Otago. Her research is focused on the design, synthesis and characterisation of functional nanoscale and nanocomposite materials, and the investigation of their efficacy for applications in the area of biomedicine; specifically, for improved medical diagnosis and targeted therapy, particularly dental therapy.
                      In 2001 Carla received her B.S. degree in Chemistry from Penn State University. From 2002 – 2004, she worked as a Research Associate in the Department of Blood Research at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Maryland, where her work involved the investigation of membrane lipid and protein interactions with novel cryo protecting agents. She then carried out her PhD study from 2004 – 2008 at Dublin City University, where her work involved the preparation and fast field-cycling NMR characterisation of membrane-bound nanoparticles and nanoparticle assemblies for biomedical applications.
                      After completing a post-doctoral assignment (2008 – 2009) at the same University, where she worked on the development of hierarchical assemblies of hybrid magnetic nanoparticle clusters for applications in magnetic resonance imaging, Carla moved to New Zealand and began her current appointment at Otago in December 2009. Carla has been an Associate Investigator in the MacDiarmid Institute since 2010.
                      Research Interests
                      Our research is directed toward the design, synthesis, and characterization of functional nanoscale materials. The interest in nanoscale materials lies in the fact that their size, shape, and composition can dramatically affect their physical and chemical properties. This phenomenon can be exploited in order to develop new materials with tunable properties for a broad range of applications. Our interests encompass both fundamental and applied aspects of nanomaterials research. Current projects are interdisciplinary, combining chemistry, materials science, physics, and biological sciences in order to develop new materials with potential application in biomedicine and for use as nanoswitches.

                        Prof. Debabrata Goswami is a Senior Professor at Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur (IITK) and holds the endowed Prof. S. Sampath Chair Professor of Chemistry. He is also Adjunct Professor at three centres of IITK, namely, Center for Lasers and Photonics, The Design Program and the Center for Cognitive Science.  His research work spans across frontiers of interdisciplinary research with femtosecond lasers that have been recognised globally, the latest being the 2018 Galileo Galilei Award of the International Commission of Optics (ICO).  As a part of his doctoral thesis at Princeton, Prof. Goswami had developed the first acousto-optic modulated ultrafast pulse shaper, wherein the 2018 Physics Nobel Prize winner, Prof. Strickland, also participated as a post-doctoral fellow at that time in the same laboratory. As a part of his independent research, Prof. Goswami was the first to propose that the phase of a laser pulse may be critical in quantum computing. One of the latest thrusts in quantum information processing and computing relies heavily on scalability and near room temperature techniques wherein Dr. Goswami’s unique optical approaches stands at the forefront. He works at the frontiers of interdisciplinary research embodying theoretical and experimental developments in the fundamental aspects of femtosecond laser-matter interactions. Use of optical approaches to exert and control spatiotemporally has been the mainstay of his research development towards scalable quantum computing systems.  The fallouts of this technology-heavy research have been many, which include superresolution microscopy, coherent control of chemical reactions, self-calibrated femtosecond optical tweezers (SCFOT), and thermal lens spectroscopy—all of which are being explored diligently in his lab.  His novel SCFOT can directly probe colloidal assembly, their structure and orientation. The same method has been applied to provide a direct measure and control of 'in situ' temperature and viscosity at microscale volumes.

                    Ph. D. in 1995 at the Rani Durgavati University Jabalpur (M. P.) Dr. Gaur has developed the well
                    equipped research laboratory in his institute. At present, he is also responsible of doctoral program
                    in Physics of nanostructured and Advanced Materials. He has chaired the 5 conferences and delivered
                    many invited talk in India and abroad. He has published 75 research papers in reputed international
                    journals. He has received “Bharat Shiksha Ratan Award”, presented by Global Society of Health and
                    Education, New Delhi for the year 2004. He is having visiting professorship of Francisk Skorina Gomel
                    State University, Gomel (Belarus). He is having joint research collaboration with Russia, Belarus and
                    USA. He has guided 7 Ph. D. in the area of nanomaterials and applications. Currently six students are
                    persuing Ph. D. under his guidance. His research is focused on synthesis of nanomaterial, preparation
                    of polymer, hybrid nanocomposites thin film and structural characterization by SEM, TEM, XRD, AFM,
                    FTIR and Raman techniques. Study of charge storage and transport processes in electro-active polymers/
                    nanocomposites by dielectric, pyroelectric, piezoelectric, ferroelectric, thermally stimulated current
                    techniques is the another area of research. Presently the principal objective of our research is to
                    understand the role of nanomaterials for development of biosensor for detection of environmental
                    hazards. We focus on colorimetric, ampereometric, chemiluminescence biosensor by applying suitable
                    nanoparticles to reduce the detection limit. The electrochemical behavior of hybrid electrodes could
                    be studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charging/discharging measurement techniques.

                      Research | Current
                      Current research is clustered in four distinct areas;
                      •	Development of efficient semiconductor catalysts for solar water splitting, alcohol photo reforming, carbon dioxide reduction and nitrogen fixation.
                      •	Fabrication of smart optical coatings, in particular photonic crystal thin films, for sensing and optoelectronic applications.
                      •	Manipulation of the composition, structure and electronic properties of rare earth-doped oxide and oxy nitride phosphors for white LED applications.
                      •	Advancement of synchrotron techniques (XPS, XANES, XRD, IR) in materials science research.
                      Our research in these areas supports the six year science plans of two NZ Centres of Research Excellence (CoREs), the MacDiarmid Institute for Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology and the Dodd Walls Centre for Photonic and Quantum Technologies.

                      Dr. Jayan Thomas, works as Associate Professor in University of Central Florida, USA. He completed his Postdoctoral fellowship in International School of Photonics, India. He served as Research Scientist, College of Optical Sciences, The University of Arizona during 2001-2005. Research in Dr. Jayan Thomas group is focused on developing nanoarchitectured energy conversion and storage devices. Recently, their group have developed a nanoarchitecturing technique using which polymer nanostructures can be printed efficiently at low cost. This technique is utilized to develop nanostructured polymer solar cells, nanoarchitectured electrodes for Li-ion batteries and supercapacitors, and printed biomolecule based photonic devices. Their nanoimprinting technique offers a simple route to fabricate large area nanostructures in a very short time. Another line of work is the development of photorefractive polymers with improved sensitivity. Photorefractive composites derived from conducting polymers offer the advantage of dynamically recorded holograms without the need of processing of any kind. Thus, they are the material of choice for many cutting edge applications, such as updatable three-dimensional (3D) displays and 3D telepresence. Further improvements in the polymer composites could bring applications in telemedicine, advertising, updatable 3D maps and entertainment. We are also working on the development of new photorefractive polymers sensitive at IR wavelengths. The group is also studying the optical limiting properties of core-shell plasmonic nanostructures. He won several prestigious awards, honors and societites such as Reach for the stars Award in 2016, R&D100 Award in 2015 and NSF CAREER award in 2014.

                    Pradeep’s work is in the area of molecular materials and surfaces. His group found that noble metal nanoparticles degrade halocarbons efficiently to amorphous carbon and metal halides at room temperature and at low concentrations. This discovery has led to the world’s first nanochemistry based water filter for pesticide removal as many pesticides of relevance are halocarbons. This technology is estimated to have reached about 7.5 million people. His group developed several technologies to remove other contaminants from drinking water. Combining several such materials, an all-inclusive affordable drinking water purifier has been developed. Exciting aspect of this technology is the creation of advanced materials by simple and environment-friendly methods. This technology, named AMRIT, is being implemented now in the arsenic affected regions of India. Very recently his group has shown that small pieces of matter behave like simple molecules, in their chemical reactions between each other. To account for their unique properties, including reactions, a nomenclature system has been introduced. They are named as aspicules, meaning ’shielded molecules’. His group discovered new methods to transform ions to novel materials. Several new phenomena have been discovered using such materials. His group introduced new methods to create ions in air and developed mass spectrometric techniques using them. His group studied the dynamics of monolayers in monolayer protected nanoparticles and showed that monolayers existed in a rotationally frozen state on nanoparticle surfaces. His group found a 'transverse electrokinetic effect' in which a potential is generated on nanoparticle assemblies anchored on surfaces, when a liquid is flown over them. His group also discovered that in the presence of metal nanoparticles, single walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) bundles emit light in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum, irrespective of whether it is metallic or semi-conducting. He and collaborators showed that equilibrium constant of the prototypical proton transfer reaction, NH3 + HCl→NH4Cl, is orders of magnitude lower on ice. Most recently he found that diffusion of chemically similar molecules through ultra-thin ice films exhibits several surprises. A new structural transition on the top-most layers of ice surfaces has been discovered at low temperatures. His group showed that 1 eV proton collisions at water ice surfaces make dihydrogen cation. From all these, it is clear that ultra-low energy ion collisions at ice surfaces manifest several surprises.

              Prof. Sebastian Lourdudoss joined KTH in 1980 after his doctoral degree in chemistry from Faculté Libre des Sciences de Lille, France. He changed his field of interest to semiconductors in 1985 when he had moved to Swedish Institute of Microelectronics, where he started to work on and develop Hydride Vapour Phase Epitaxy. In 1993 he moved back to KTH where he is currently a professor and head of Department of Materials and Nano Physics. He has contributed to the development of semi-insulating III-V materials for discrete and integrated device fabrication and integration of III-Vs on silicon all with Hydride Vapour Phase Epitaxy. He received IPRM award for the year 2017 during Compound Semiconductor Week to be held in Berlin, Germany in May 2017. Along with his colleagues, Prof. Lourdudoss persistently developed hydride vapour phase epitaxy (HVPE) technology and demonstrated its flexibility in fabricating buried heterostructures (BHs) of different types of devices for different applications. In the initial stages, edge emitting and vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSEL), and later, in collaboration with American researchers, integrated photonic circuits were demonstrated for telecom/Datacom applications. More recently, his team addressed mid-infrared quantum cascade lasers in collaboration with several leading European partners in a EU project. Their long term efforts to integrate III-V semiconductors on silicon for silicon photonics have attracted international attention.
